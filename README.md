### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dale Mitchell, and I'm a technology aficionado with a talent for tinkering. With a coding background that includes C#, .NET, SQL, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and Vue.js. I thrive on taking on complex projects and devising innovative solutions that tackle real-world problems. 

Beyond the keyboard, you can find me indulging in a little hobby of mine: building computers from scratch, bringing together all the components, and witnessing a machine come to life. When I'm not plugged in, you'll often find me hitting the open road on my motorcycle, soaking up the wind in my face and the thrill of adventure. Whether I'm coding or cruising, I'm always hungry for fresh challenges and eager to push the boundaries of what's possible.
